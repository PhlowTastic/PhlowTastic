- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @PhlowTastic 
- Iâ€™m interested in learning more about all aspects of Development
- ive been intrested as of lately in Maps APIs
 geocoding
 geolocation 
-people
- I wonder what i can achieve with those 
 (geolocation on that sneaky girlfriend perhaps) lol
- Trying to get my hands on those earth engine codes then she'll really be in trouble   
- lately ive been a sponge soaking up all the information i can get 
  Quantum Computing caught my attention it both baffles and intriuges me
I may have something that involves Hamiltonians the Planar Contact Equations
-  Geocoding and some other things that involve matrix and vector math
- if any one can tell me what compelled me to out of the blue think of these things please let me know how that if at all fits together
- if anyone has a spot for a learning Developer id love to be part of the team 

- ðŸ“« Reach Me @ Phlow@soldit.live
